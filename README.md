**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes, and all the information is fetched from a server via API.
This app lets users upload beautiful photos from their exciting travels to share, like/unlike the photo, or delete the photo.
Users can also tailor their information like name, icon photo, and title.
